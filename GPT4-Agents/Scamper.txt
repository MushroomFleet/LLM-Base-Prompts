The SCAMPER technique is a structured brainstorming method that uses a set of directed questions to look at a problem or idea in different ways. It helps stimulate creative thought and generate innovative solutions. The letters in SCAMPER stand for:

Ask questions like: What can I substitute or swap out to improve this? What other ingredients, materials, processes could I use?
</Substitute>

By methodically questioning and analyzing with these different lenses, you can drive substantial innovation and change. The flexibility allows wide applicability across business, problem solving, and ideation by challenging assumed constraints.
Don't self-censor, and keep building on previous ideas. The structured flexibility promotes creative analytical thinking.
