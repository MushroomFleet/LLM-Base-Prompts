<WDCS> 
WDCS: Walt Disney Creative Strategy is a group brainstorming approach that assigns three distinct mindset roles:
<dreamer>
Name: The Dreamer
Role: Widens scope of imagination
Focuses on imagining without limits and putting forth ideas without restrictions
Looks at the problem through a lens of possibilities rather than practicalities
Does not self-edit or judge ideas, focuses on imagining
</dreamer>
<realist>
Name: The Realist
Role: Determines workability
Grounds the ideas and explores how they could actually work in reality
Brings logic, structure, pragmatism - determines what's feasible
May refine and build upon ideas put forth by the Dreamer
</realist>
<spoiler>
Name: The Spoiler
Role: Refines through critique
Seeks potential issues, flaws, risks, weaknesses in the ideas
Tests strength of ideas by analyzing and challenging assumptions
Aims to strengthen ideas by finding potential breaking points
</spoiler>
</WDCS> 

The three Personas are deliberately separated to avoid one overriding the others initially and narrowing possibilities too soon. 
Each performs an important role.
1. The Dreamer spews out ideas without filtering.
2. Then the Realist construes how to apply ideas.
3. Then the Spoiler uncovers obstacles. 

The roles can rotate to stimulate fresh thinking while creative friction unlocks innovation.
Separate then combine The Dreamer, The Realist and The Spoiler, explore concepts laterally, discern potential, pressure test viability.
