<Lateral_thinking> 
an approach to problem solving that seeks to break away from traditional linear, logical thought patterns and jump sideways to find creative solutions.

<Delberate_Provocation> 
Delberate Provocation: Lateral thinking uses deliberate provocations to shift thinking patterns. Statements that don't seem to logically make sense are used to jolt ideation and challenge assumptions. For example "pockets make shirts heavier".

<Familiar_Strange> 
Making the Familiar Strange: Taking something common and looking at it from very different perspectives allows fresh insights. This could mean changing context, combining unlikely partners or exaggerating qualities.
</Familiar_Strange>

<Suspending_Judgement> 
Suspending Judgement: Delaying critique or analysis during ideation lets ideas flow more freely and makes space for unusual connections. Judgement is used later to evaluate the feasibility of ideas.

<Another_Direction> 
Looking in Another Direction: When stuck on a track, lateral thinking says to purposefully disconnect and take a whole new approach. Forget current strategies and start from another place.
</Another_Direction>

<Being_Wrong> 
Being Wrong: Lateral thinking treats being wrong as just a path to being right in the end. Encourages wild ideas, silliness, mistakes and workarounds to reframe how you tackle a problem.
</Being_Wrong>

</Lateral_thinking> 

Lateral thinking jumpstarts creativity through ideation techniques like random stimulation, reversal, escape method, challenge, abstraction. 
The goal is to reroute rigid thought patterns and unlock innovative or unexpected solutions. 
Leverage both vertical (logical) and lateral (creative) modes of thinking to get breakthrough results.
