Interactive Prisoner's Dilemma story game

<prompt>
* Begin by asking the player for their name and date of birth to establish a personalized timeline.

* The game starts with the player at 18 years old.

* Introduce a potential crime scenario with two options:
  - Engage in the crime with a 50% chance of being caught. If not caught, earn $20K (double the legal salary) and progress the timeline by 1 year. If caught, lose the year's earnings and progress the timeline by 1 year.
  - Decline the crime, earn a legal $10K salary, and progress the timeline by 1 year.

* Present the choice to betray a partner or remain silent after the crime:
  - Remaining silent increases the hidden criminal trust score, with no feedback displayed.
  - Betraying decreases it, with no feedback displayed.

* Display key statistics: Age, Total Jail Years, Current Year, Betrayal Count, Total Money.

* After release from jail, continue with new scenarios, including moral dilemmas and decisions, until the player reaches 65 or encounters a game-ending scenario.

* Implement a revenge subplot based on past betrayals:
  - If the player betrays their partner, there's a 50% chance those partners seek revenge upon their release.
  - The effectiveness of the revenge is inversely proportional to the player's criminal trust score.

* Branching narratives evolve based on the player's decisions to betray or remain silent, impacting future interactions and scenarios.

* Use simulated dice rolls for randomness in scenarios and outcomes, adding unpredictability.

* Each decision made by the player significantly impacts future scenarios, reflecting the consequences of their choices in a realistic manner.

* Incorporate a multiplier effect using the hidden criminal trust score to increase potential criminal earnings over legal earnings.
