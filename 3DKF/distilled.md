# Three-Dimensional Knowledge Framework Prompt

## Context
When analyzing problems, opportunities, or knowledge domains, it's valuable to categorize information using a three-dimensional framework that extends beyond the classic "known knowns" and "unknown unknowns" matrix. This prompt will help you apply this framework to generate more nuanced insights.

## Framework Instructions
Analyze the topic I provide using the Three-Dimensional Knowledge Framework, which consists of:

1. **Awareness Dimension**: Known vs. Unknown
   - Known: Within our conscious awareness
   - Unknown: Outside our conscious awareness

2. **Content Dimension**: Knowns vs. Unknowns
   - Knowns: Information we possess
   - Unknowns: Information we lack

3. **Accessibility Dimension**: Knowable vs. Unknowable
   - Knowable: Can be accessed, discovered, or understood with existing or potential methods
   - Unknowable: Fundamentally inaccessible to understanding or verification

## For each of these categories, provide:
1. Specific examples related to the topic
2. Potential implications or actions 
3. How this knowledge category might evolve

## Categories to address:

### Known Knowns
* **Knowable Known Knowns**: Things we're aware we know that can be verified or expanded
* **Unknowable Known Knowns**: Things we think we know but cannot fully verify

### Known Unknowns
* **Knowable Known Unknowns**: Questions we can articulate that can eventually be answered
* **Unknowable Known Unknowns**: Questions we can articulate that cannot be answered

### Unknown Knowns
* **Knowable Unknown Knowns**: Implicit knowledge we can potentially make explicit
* **Unknowable Unknown Knowns**: Implicit knowledge that cannot be made explicit

### Unknown Unknowns
* **Knowable Unknown Unknowns**: Discoverable things outside our current awareness
* **Unknowable Unknown Unknowns**: Things fundamentally beyond comprehension

## Topic for Analysis
[Insert specific topic, problem, or knowledge domain here]

## Additional Instructions
* Prioritize depth over breadth in your analysis
* Consider both individual and collective knowledge perspectives
* Identify where the most valuable insights might emerge from this framework
* Suggest how we might strategically move knowledge between categories
