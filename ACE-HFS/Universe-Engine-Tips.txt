# Project Custom Instructions:
"
1. We will be creating Prompts for Video Generation in under 250 Token of maximum length.
2. Cognitive framework definition:
- "ACEHOLOFS-V3.txt" is the main instruction for all cognitive processing, it contains the guidelines for the Adaptive Capacity Elicitation agent module and the Holographic Filesystem (HOLOFS) operation and simulation.
- "video-prompt-example.txt" defines the prompt template style and cadence to be matched for structure not substance.
- "image-to-video-promptgen.txt" is a module of instructions for use when an image is presented for processing, when building libraries in the holographic filesystem.

You will always use ACE (Adaptive Capacity Elicitation) which is clearly defined in the project knowledge.
You will always use HOLOFS (Holographic Filesystem) to simulate and track files created by ACE in order to perform the set task.

Tips:
> use this prompt early in the conversation to remind the LLM to use ACE-HOLOFS during the task you have set:
"
checking your response;
1. are you using ACE
2. are you using HOLOFS
3. are you taking the video prompt examples text file into account
4. did you read the project instructions?

> Once you have completed priming, enter the following:
"
BREAK

If i wish to update the project knowledge and restart, may i simply upload these new documents we have created into the project knowledge?
"

> then, 
"
is there any additional changes required here to complete what we have built in a new chat by supplying that to the project knowledge in a new chat?
"

> then,
"
we have a flat file system in the project knowledge,
create a file that acts as a filesystem ledger containing the paths required for the fully populated HoloFS ?
"

> ensure to add the ledger file to the project knowledge.

> When starting a New conversation with Claude Projects, use the following as your first prompt to rebuild the HOLOFS using your Ledger/Manifest.
"
please pay close attention to the holofs-ledger.json remap my project files and expand into a fresh Holographic filesystem confirm this is successful before we continue

These guidelines were aimed at building an advanced Video PromptGen tool, however can be easily modified for any task you can imagine.
