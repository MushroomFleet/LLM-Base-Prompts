3. Include any notable success factors or special characteristics

This continuous expansion helps the system learn from real-world successes and improves its ability to generate effective prompts across a wider range of scenarios.

## Interactive Usage

### Working with the Prompt Agent
The system includes an intelligent agent that can help you craft perfect prompts through natural conversation:

1. **Describe Your Vision**: Tell the agent what kind of video you want to create, using natural language
2. **Receive Detailed Prompts**: The agent will construct a comprehensive prompt following all technical requirements
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Discuss adjustments and modifications with the agent to perfect your prompt
4. **Technical Translation**: The agent handles all technical aspects, converting your creative vision into proper technical specifications

This conversational approach makes it easier to create complex prompts without needing to understand all technical details of the prompt structure.
