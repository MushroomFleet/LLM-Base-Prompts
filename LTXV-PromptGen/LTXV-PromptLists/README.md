# LTXV Prompt Lists

This folder contains structured video scene prompts crafted specifically for the LTXV (Latent Text-to-Video) model format. These prompts are designed to maintain consistent patterns, token distributions, and scene structuring as defined in the original LTXV examples.

## Project Integration

These prompt lists are mirrored in the [DJZnodes Project](https://github.com/MushroomFleet/DJZ-Nodes/tree/main/prompts) as part of an ongoing effort to standardize and improve text-to-video prompt engineering.

Future LTXV prompt lists will be maintained and updated in both repositories to ensure consistency and accessibility across projects.

## Format

Each prompt list follows strict LTXV formatting guidelines including:
- Structured scene descriptions
- Consistent camera direction notation
- Specific lighting and atmosphere details
- Scene type classification
- Token distribution optimization
- Proper density and information balance

## Updates

This collection will continue to expand with new categories and genre-specific prompt lists, all maintaining the established LTXV format and structure.
