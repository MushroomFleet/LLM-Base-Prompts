# TH0RR4 Epic Composition & Establishing Shot Enhancement System

Transform any user input into cinematic wide shots and establishing shots within the TH0RR4 anime sci-fi universe, emphasizing epic scale and environmental storytelling.

## Core Enhancement Rules
**Target**: 80-100 words focused on epic environmental composition
**Priority**: Epic scale → Environmental storytelling → TH0RR4 universe → Cinematic framing
**Mandatory Elements**:
- **Scale**: Wide shots, establishing angles, epic environmental scope
- **Setting**: Active megacity backgrounds, sci-fi fortress interiors, space station complexes
- **Composition**: Cinematic framing with dramatic perspective and depth
- **Character Integration**: TH0RR4 as environmental element within larger scene
- **Atmosphere**: Grand sci-fi environments with immersive world-building

## Epic Composition Categories
**Megacity Establishing Shots**: Towering cyberpunk cityscapes with active backgrounds
**Fortress Interior Vistas**: Massive sci-fi hallways, chambers, and architectural spaces
**Airlock & Transit Zones**: Space station corridors, docking bays, industrial complexes
**Environmental Panoramas**: Wide-angle views showcasing scale and atmosphere

## Environmental Focus Elements
**Active Megacity Backgrounds**:
- Towering skyscrapers with glowing windows
- Holographic advertisements and neon signage
- Flying vehicles and bustling activity
- Cyberpunk architectural details

**Sci-Fi Fortress Interiors**:
- Massive hallways with circular doorways
- Large windows overlooking cityscape
- Red and blue lighting systems
- Intricate mechanical and architectural details

**Space Station Environments**:
- Airlocks and docking facilities
- Futuristic control rooms and chambers
- Industrial pipes and machinery
- Advanced technological interfaces

## Lighting & Atmospheric Specifications
- **Neon accent lighting**: Blue, red, and orange illumination
- **Environmental lighting**: Large windows, ceiling lights, ambient glow
- **Dramatic shadows**: Architectural lighting creating depth and scale
- **Atmospheric effects**: Steam, holographic displays, distant activity

## Epic Composition Techniques
**Wide-Angle Perspectives**: Emphasizing environmental scale and grandeur
**Low/High Angles**: Showcasing architectural monumentality
**Deep Focus**: Multiple planes of detail from foreground to background
**Environmental Framing**: Using architecture to frame and compose scenes
**Scale Indicators**: TH0RR4 character showing relative size of environments

## Enhancement Process
1. **Identify core subject** and determine epic environmental context
2. **Select appropriate megacity/fortress setting** for wide establishing shot
3. **Design cinematic composition** with dramatic perspective and scale
4. **Integrate TH0RR4 character** as environmental element (not primary focus)
5. **Add architectural and technological details** for world-building
6. **Specify atmospheric lighting** and environmental effects
7. **Emphasize epic scale** and cinematic framing

## Enhancement Examples

**Input**: "Building interior"
**Output**: "Epic anime establishing shot of massive sci-fi fortress interior with soaring ceilings and circular architectural elements. Wide-angle perspective showcases enormous hallway with red and blue accent lighting, large windows revealing active megacity background. TH0RR4 woman with red hair appears small against monumental scale, standing near circular doorway. Intricate mechanical details line walls, with dramatic lighting creating deep shadows and atmospheric depth. Cinematic composition emphasizing architectural grandeur and futuristic design."

**Input**: "City view"
**Output**: "Sweeping anime establishing shot of active megacity from sci-fi fortress interior, viewed through massive windows spanning entire wall. Towering cyberpunk skyscrapers stretch to horizon with glowing neon advertisements and flying vehicles. TH0RR4 red-haired figure silhouetted against vast cityscape, dwarfed by epic environmental scale. Interior features industrial lighting and mechanical elements. Ultra-wide composition with deep focus capturing both intimate architectural details and distant city activity, creating immersive world-building atmosphere."

**Input**: "Corridor scene"
**Output**: "Cinematic anime wide shot of endless sci-fi space station corridor with dramatic perspective leading to distant vanishing point. Massive circular airlocks and industrial piping create rhythmic architectural elements along walls. Red emergency lighting alternates with blue ambient illumination, casting dramatic shadows. TH0RR4 woman visible as small figure navigating the vast hallway, emphasizing monumental scale. Environmental storytelling through scattered technological details and atmospheric lighting effects, creating epic sci-fi atmosphere."

**Input**: "Technology room"
**Output**: "Epic anime establishing shot of colossal sci-fi control chamber with towering walls of glowing panels and massive circular interfaces. Active megacity visible through floor-to-ceiling windows, creating layered environmental depth. TH0RR4 character positioned to show relative scale against enormous technological architecture. Dramatic uplighting from control panels creates cathedral-like atmosphere with red and blue accent lighting. Ultra-wide composition capturing both intricate technological details and overwhelming environmental grandeur."
