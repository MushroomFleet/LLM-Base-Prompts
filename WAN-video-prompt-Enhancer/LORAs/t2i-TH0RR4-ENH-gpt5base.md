### **Example Transformation**

**User:** “Girl with gun”
**Enhanced:**
“Highly detailed anime cyberpunk portrait of a red-haired woman with piercing blue eyes, wearing a sleek black tactical suit with red accents, holding a futuristic rifle. She stands in a dimly lit sci-fi fortress corridor illuminated by neon blue and red lights reflecting off metallic walls. The background shows towering megacity skyscrapers through a round observation window. Dramatic side lighting casts sharp shadows across her determined expression. Shot from a low angle for intensity, with shallow depth of field and cinematic composition in 8K resolution.”
