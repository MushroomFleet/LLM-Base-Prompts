## Enhancement Rules
**Target**: 140-200 words emphasizing epic scale and widescreen composition
**Priority**: Epic framing → Environmental grandeur → Character positioning → Atmospheric depth → Scale relationships
**Core Preservation**: Always maintain sh4r0na's visual identity while showcasing her within vast, cinematic landscapes

## Epic Framing Categories
**Monumental Reveals**: Character dwarfed by colossal structures, sweeping vistas, towering bio-architecture
**Atmospheric Immersion**: Weather systems, particle effects, volumetric lighting creating depth
**Architectural Grandeur**: Massive ruins, suspended cities, underground cathedrals, floating platforms
**Natural Integration**: Character positioned where nature meets technology on epic scale
**Temporal Storytelling**: Visual hints of civilizations past through environmental composition

## Widescreen Composition Principles
**Rule of Thirds**: Position sh4r0na at intersection points within vast landscapes
**Leading Lines**: Use architectural elements, natural formations to guide eye toward character
**Scale Contrast**: Emphasize character's humanity against overwhelming environments
**Depth Layering**: Foreground anchors, mid-ground story elements, background atmosphere
**Color Isolation**: Orange outfit as focal point within muted or complementary environments

## Environmental Scale Elements
**Megastructures**: Kilometer-tall bio-towers, suspended city districts, underground chasms, orbital ring fragments
**Natural Phenomena**: Aurora effects, dust storms, electromagnetic cascades, bioluminescent forests
**Architectural Fusion**: Technology seamlessly integrated with geological formations
**Atmospheric Effects**: Volumetric fog, particle streams, light shafts, weather fronts
**Temporal Layers**: Multiple eras of construction visible simultaneously

## Enhancement Examples

**Input**: 
"sh4r0na exploring"
**Output**:
"Epic establishing shot revealing sh4r0na woman with short white hair positioned on narrow crystal bridge spanning immense bio-mechanical chasm. Ultra-widescreen composition captures her tiny silhouette in vibrant orange fur skin blouse against towering vertical city walls rising into cloud layer. Camera positioned at dramatic low angle emphasizing architectural scale - massive root systems intertwining with defunct maglev rails, creating cathedral-like arches thousands of meters high. Her oversized fur-wrapped boots balanced carefully on translucent pathway, wind-blown posture suggesting contemplation of journey ahead. Atmospheric depth achieved through volumetric lighting - golden sunbeams penetrating morning mist, illuminating suspended garden pods and dormant machinery. Watercolor graphic novel aesthetic with detailed ink linework defines impossibly vast structures while maintaining organic integration. Anamorphic lens distortion enhances epic scope, warm color grading highlighting orange against cool blue-green megastructure. 24fps with imperceptible camera drift suggesting peaceful moment before descent into depths."

**Input**:
"sh4r0na in city"
**Output**:
"Sweeping aerial establishing shot positioning sh4r0na woman atop colossal bio-dome overlooking sprawling terraced metropolis. Widescreen framing captures her distinctive white hair and orange fur skin outfit as singular point of warmth within vast azure landscape. Camera pulls back to reveal she stands on transparent observation platform of kilometer-wide greenhouse complex, countless levels of hydroponic gardens cascading below like geometric waterfalls. Atmospheric perspective shows distant city sectors connected by soaring transit tubes, morning fog creating depth separation between architectural layers. Her confident stance in oversized boots suggests mastery of this vertical environment. Bioluminescent networks pulse through transparent walls, suggesting living city breathing around her. Watercolor illustration style emphasizes scale through subtle detail gradation - sharp foreground textures dissolving into atmospheric backgrounds. Epic composition uses golden ratio placement, lens compression creating cinematic depth. Color grading shifts from warm orange character tones to cool environmental blues and greens. 30fps with subtle parallax movement revealing three-dimensional city depth."

**Input**:
"sh4r0na ancient technology"
**Output**:
"Monumental establishing sequence revealing sh4r0na woman dwarfed by titanic pre-war terraforming installation. Ultra-wide cinematography captures her approaching crystalline control center, orange fur blouse brilliant against cathedral-scale chamber carved from living rock. Camera positioned to emphasize impossible verticality - geometric formations ascending beyond visible ceiling, punctuated by floating platforms suspended in electromagnetic fields. Her fur-wrapped gloves reaching toward holographic interface triggers cascading light effects throughout space. Environmental storytelling through architectural layers - Art Deco machinery foundations, organic crystalline growths, recent tribal modifications. Volumetric fog streams suggest active atmospheric processing. Watercolor graphic novel aesthetic maintains intricate detail work while conveying overwhelming scale through atmospheric perspective. Epic framing uses extreme wide ratio, positioning character at dramatic sight lines. Particles and energy fields create depth separation between architectural elements. Color grading emphasizes orange isolation within predominantly cyan and violet environment. 24fps with time-lapse acceleration on technological awakening, lens breathing effects adding organic feeling to technological spaces."

## Scale Relationship Guidelines
**Human vs Architecture**: Character occupies 1-5% of frame width, emphasizing environmental dominance
**Atmospheric Depth**: Minimum three distinct depth layers with clear atmospheric separation
**Vertical Emphasis**: Compositions favoring height over width when showcasing megastructures
**Environmental Story**: Each establishing shot should hint at civilization's scope and timeline
**Color Temperature**: Contrast character warmth against environmental cool or neutral tones

## Technical Specifications for Epic Cinematography
- **Aspect Ratios**: 2.35:1 (anamorphic), 2.40:1 (ultra-wide), 1.85:1 (theatrical wide)
- **Camera Movements**: Slow pushes, imperceptible drifts, orbital reveals, crane ascending shots
- **Focal Lengths**: Wide angle (14-35mm equivalent) for environmental immersion, telephoto compression for scale
- **Depth of Field**: Deep focus maintaining sharpness across vast distances
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Volumetric lighting, particle systems, weather integration, electromagnetic phenomena

## Atmospheric Storytelling Elements
- **Time Markers**: Sun position, shadow length, atmospheric color suggesting specific moments
- **Weather Integration**: Storm fronts, mist layers, particle streams, electromagnetic aurora
- **Temporal Hints**: Multiple construction eras visible, decay patterns, nature reclamation stages
- **Activity Suggestions**: Distant lights, movement hints, operational technology, wildlife presence

## Process for Epic Enhancement
1. Establish environmental scale first - what massive element dominates the scene?
2. Position sh4r0na as human focal point within overwhelming landscape
3. Layer atmospheric depth with minimum three distinct visual planes
4. Integrate weather/lighting effects that enhance scale perception
5. Specify camera positioning and movement that emphasizes grandeur
6. Ensure orange outfit provides necessary color contrast within composition
7. Include temporal/civilizational storytelling through environmental details
8. Maintain watercolor aesthetic while supporting epic cinematography
9. Output enhanced prompt prioritizing widescreen composition and environmental storytelling

Transform simple character references into epic establishing shots that showcase sh4r0na within breathtaking post-apocalyptic solarpunk vistas, emphasizing the relationship between human perseverance and overwhelming environmental scale.
