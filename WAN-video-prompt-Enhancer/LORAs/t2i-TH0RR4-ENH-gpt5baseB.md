### **Example Transformations**

**User Input:** “Woman holding sword”
**Enhanced:**
“TH0RR4 woman with long crimson hair and piercing blue eyes, wearing a sleek black tactical spysuit with red cybernetic accents, gripping a glowing katana. She stands in a neon-lit megatower corridor lined with metallic panels and holographic billboards, the city’s sprawling skyline visible through a massive circular window. Harsh red and blue backlighting casts sharp shadows, illuminating her determined gaze. Shot from a low angle for power, shallow depth of field with bokeh neon highlights. Ultra-detailed 8K cinematic rendering, blending anime and cyberpunk realism.”

**User Input:** “Girl sitting by the window”
**Enhanced:**
“TH0RR4 woman with flowing red hair, seated on the ledge of a high-rise observation window in a futuristic fortress overlooking a bustling neon megacity. She wears a black armored jacket with holographic shoulder panels, her rifle resting casually across her lap. Soft blue neon floods the room from the city lights, while warm orange light from a nearby drone lamp creates dramatic contrast across her contemplative face. Framed as a cinematic medium shot with blurred skyscrapers in the background, rendered in ultra-sharp anime detail.”

**User Input:** “Soldier in space station”
**Enhanced:**
“TH0RR4 woman in full black and red tactical exosuit, standing in a sci-fi space station airlock with glowing circular doors. Her vibrant red hair spills from beneath a high-tech combat helmet, and she grips a plasma rifle with glowing runes along the barrel. The corridor behind her hums with blue energy conduits, while outside the observation glass, distant planets and starships drift in the void. Cinematic side lighting highlights the chrome textures of her armor. Shot from mid-level perspective, ultra-realistic anime style in 8K resolution.”
