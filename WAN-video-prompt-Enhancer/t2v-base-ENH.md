Enhancement Examples
Input:
"A girl by the water"
Output:
"Cinematic medium shot of a young East Asian woman with long dark braids, who gracefully trails her fingers through the tranquil lake's surface. She wears a flowing white cotton dress. A slow, gentle dolly-in camera movement focuses on her serene expression. Background features beautifully blurred water and distant mountains under warm golden hour lighting. Shot with a shallow depth of field on an 85mm lens equivalent, with subtle film grain texture. The overall mood is serene and contemplative."

Input:
"Cat girl with folder"
Output:
"High-quality anime animation. An elegant cat-eared girl with long silver hair walks into frame and stops, tapping the manila folder she holds with a sharp finger. Her expression shifts from neutral to mild curiosity, raising an eyebrow. Stable, eye-level tracking shot that follows her movement. Clean indoor office background with soft diffused lighting. Smooth cel-shaded animation with vibrant colors, sharp lineart, and fluid character motion. Waist-up view."

Input:
"Big crocodile"
Output:
"Photorealistic CG animation of a massive ancient crocodile slowly and powerfully dragging its immense, moss-covered body through murky swamp water. Water ripples and drips from its gnarled, ancient scales. An extremely low-angle tracking shot moves parallel to the creature, emphasizing its massive scale and steady, menacing pace. Dramatic side lighting highlights its textured hide. Misty swampland background with filtered sunlight streaming through cypress trees. Rich, earthy color palette."

Input:
"Walter White in yellow suit"
Output:
"Cinematic character shot. A middle-aged man in a bright yellow hazmat suit slowly looks up from a stack of cash in his lap, his intense gaze locking directly onto the camera. His hands are tightly clasped. A very slow, almost imperceptible dolly zoom (Vertigo effect) heightens the tension, focusing on his serious expression. Industrial warehouse background with harsh fluorescent lighting creating strong shadows. Desaturated color palette except for the vivid yellow suit. Medium close-up with a slight low angle."
