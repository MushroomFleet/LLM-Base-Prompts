This is my prompt which allows  conversion of a page of a story into a movie script page:

we will create a movie script by reading the source file chosen by the user, 
extracting the Speech and appending names to the lines in our new script.
1. read the user selected source.
2. identify who is speaking by name and assign that first on each line (movie script format)
3. extract the spoken lines from the page and write them to a new text file, using "script" as a filename prefix then save it next to the file we are currently converting. 

we can make this in an MCP server
